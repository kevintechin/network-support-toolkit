# Validation Record — NetworkHealthCheck v1.1.0

## Windows acceptance run · 2026-07-28

- **Environment:** Windows 11 Pro (10.0.26200), Windows PowerShell 5.1.26100, standard user, console mode (`-ConsoleOnly`)
- **Result: Overall Healthy** — Pass 20 / Warning 0 / Fail 0 / Unable-to-check 0 · exit code 0 · ~21 s end to end
- All three report formats generated and well-formed (HTML / TXT / JSON)
- Multi-adapter aggregation limitation (technical guide §8.5) observed exactly as documented: virtual adapters (VirtualBox, Hyper-V) listed alongside the active Wi-Fi NIC
- Judgment gating confirmed live: TCP retransmission rate evaluated only after the sent-segment sample exceeded `MinimumTcpSegmentsForRate`

## Independent code review · 2026-07-28

- **Scope:** full read of the 2,825-line en-US script; grep sweeps for any system-mutating command; both language versions parsed with the real Windows PowerShell 5.1 engine; extracted math helpers unit-tested under 5.1 (IPv4-in-CIDR 12/12, mask-to-prefix 5/5, safe converters)
- **Verdict: approved with caveats — zero critical findings**
- **Read-only claim verified:** every filesystem write is confined to the tool's own `Reports/` folder or `%TEMP%`; active network behavior is limited to ping / DNS lookup / TCP connect / HTTP GET, as documented
- **Localization integrity verified:** en-US and zh-TW compile to identical 56-function token skeletons — localization cannot drift behavior

### Verified-correct highlights

- Every counter delta (adapter errors/discards, TCP retransmissions) carries an explicit reset/overflow guard — no wrapped or negative numbers reach a verdict
- "Unable to check" (ERROR) is kept separate from "problem detected" (FAIL) end to end; the tool never conflates *couldn't measure* with *network broken*
- Overall verdict priority FAIL > ERROR > WARN > PASS lives in a single authority function used by all three report formats

## Known issues — backlog for v1.1.1

1. **GUI fallback gap (major):** `Initialize-Gui`'s try/catch covers assembly loading only; an exception thrown during form construction exits with code 1 instead of falling back to console mode. Fix: wrap the entire function body.
2. On report-write failure the emergency report is produced twice (double dialog in GUI mode).
3. If one of the three report formats fails, the whole run is treated as a report failure — "Open Report" stays disabled even when HTML/TXT succeeded.
4. Retransmission thresholds are parsed with raw `[double]` casts (inconsistent with the `ConvertTo-IntSafe` defensive style; a non-numeric config value degrades that step to ERROR). Packet-loss/latency thresholds silently round decimals to integers.
5. CIM fallback path: an IPv6 gateway can satisfy the "IPv4 default gateway" check; a null DHCP state maps to "static" instead of "unknown".
6. Dead stores to clean up: `$script:NetworkSnapshot`, local `$systemSummary`.
